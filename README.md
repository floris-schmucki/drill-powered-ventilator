# THIS IS AN UNFINISHED PROTOTYPE, IT'S FOR ENGINEERING ONLY, IT'S NOT READY TO BE USED IN A MEDICAL SETTING
watch this video: https://youtu.be/0H2JInPSdMQ
IMPORTANT watch this update here where i implemented 3 features that were really needed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBr-acpuLtk
(the 3 features are: adjustable speed, different cycle time for exhale and inhale, and reliable overpressure release)
I think i forgot to publish the 3d files for these updated features, and i don't have them on my laptop here. 
If you need them, write a comment on these youtube videos. 
Or you can just re-create those 3-4 parts, it's not that complicated, i show and explain them pretty well in that update video.
